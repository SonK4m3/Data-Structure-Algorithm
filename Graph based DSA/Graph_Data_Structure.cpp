							/** Graph Data Structure **/
/*
	- A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are
	connected to other nodes.
	
	- Graph Representation:
		1. Adjacency Matrix
		2. Adjacency List
	
	- Graph Operations:
		1. Check if the element is present in the graph
		2. Graph Traversal
		3. ADd elements to graph
		4. Finding the path from one vertex to another
