            Asymptotic Analysis: Big-O Notation and More
    
    - The efficieny of an algorithm depends on the amuont of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm. The efficiency is measured with the help of asymptotic notations.

    - An algorithm may not have the same performance for different types of inputs. With the increase in the input size, the performance will change.

    - The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as asymptotic analysis.

    Asymptotic Notations

        - Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.

        - When the input array is either sorted nor in reverse order, then it takes average time. These durations are denoted using asymptotic notations.

        - Three asymptotic notations:
            1. Big-O notation
            2. Omega notation
            3. Theta notation

    1. Big-O notation
        
        - Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running tim of an algorithm. Thus, it gives the worst-case complexity Ã² an algorithm.

        - Since it gives the worst-case running time of an algorithm, it is widely used to analyze an algorithm as we are always interested in the worst-case scenario.

    2. Omega notation

        - Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the beat case complexity of an algorithm.

    3. Theta notation

        - Theta notation encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used fo analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm.
